# fetrust
a minimal and fast system info program

## For downloading: 
```
cargo build --release && \
sudo mv ./target/release/fetrust /usr/local/bin #replace sudo with doas if you don't have sudo.
```

### TODO List:
- [X] Config support
- [X] Automatic creating config folder/files
- [ ] Making it works without any library and bloat blobs (failed) 
- [ ] Getting more information from device
- [X] Writing ASCII art depends on distro
- [ ] Getting ram usage
<!-- "- [X] Support" wth is that, bruh creyde.sh -->

Thanks.
